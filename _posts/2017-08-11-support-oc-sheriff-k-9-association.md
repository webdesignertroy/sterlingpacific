<div>Sterling Pacific Meat Company is proud to sponsor the Orange County K-9 Association. This incredible unit features specially trained officers and dogs to provide valuable support in responding to incidents with armed or dangerous suspects, in-progress felonies, searches for articles such as narcotics or explosives, and more.</div>

<div>      "Police canines are a tremendous asset to police departments and the community. The Orange County K-9 Association operates as a section 501 (c)(3), thereby relying on donations. It is an honor to be a part of such an incredible support network for this association's training and other needs."</div>
