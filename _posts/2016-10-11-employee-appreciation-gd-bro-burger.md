<div>Enjoy photos from another terrific Employee Appreciation event which featured an employee gift raffle, bean bag patty toss, and delicious stuffed burgers from GD Bro Burger.</div>
<div></div>
<div>GD Bro Burger fired up food truck grills for more than 200 Sterling Pacific Meat Company employees and served their unique "Globally Delicious" signature stuffed burgers featuring Sterling Pacific Meat Company premium Angus beef. Since opening in early 2013, GD Bro earned accolades competing in the Great Food Truck Race - and their tasty, stuffed burgers and fries were a crowd favorite.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A big thank you to GD Bro Burger and to our terrific, hardworking, knowledgeable and dedicated employees!</div>
