<div>Enjoy photos from our June 2016 Employee Appreciation Event where Habit Burger Grill brought 26,000 pounds of burger heaven to Sterling Pacific Meat Company in the form of one of their famous Habit Burger trucks.  Friendly, fun-loving Habit Burger staff fired up grills on site and served up the "Best Tasting Burger In America" to Sterling employees.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Thank you to Habit Burger Grill - and thank you to our hardworking, knowledgeable and dedicated employees  for all you do.</div>
