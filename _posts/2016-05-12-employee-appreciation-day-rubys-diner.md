<div>Enjoy photos from our May 2016 Employee Appreciation Event where Ruby's took us back 1940's American classic diner style. The Ruby's truck sizzled and made scrumptious cheeseburgers, fries and shakes to order as we shooby doobied and feasted.</div>

<div>Thank you to Ruby's Diner for bringing the Ruby's truck with hot grills, friendly staff and amazing food - and to our hardworking, knowledgeable andÂ dedicated employees</div>
<div>for all you do.</div>
